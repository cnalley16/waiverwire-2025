# NextAuth.js - Generate a secure random string
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random"

# Optional: Email configuration for production
# EMAIL_SERVER_USER=

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Verify your `DATABASE_URL` is correct
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running (if using local)
   - Check network connectivity (if using cloud)

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set
   - Clear browser cookies and try again

3. **Build Errors**
