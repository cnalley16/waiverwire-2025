# Database Setup Instructions

## Overview
Your Waiver Wire fantasy football app now has a complete foundation with TypeScript types, API endpoints, and UI components. To complete the setup, you need to initialize your database with the provided schema.

## Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Database Schema Setup

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Navigate to your project: `muuykkdjswanxszqsdyl` 
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

2. **Execute the Database Schema**
   - Copy the entire contents of `src/lib/database/schema.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute the schema

   This will create:
   - All necessary tables (nfl_players, player_projections, player_risk_analysis, etc.)
   - Indexes for optimal performance
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Sample data for testing

3. **Verify the Setup**
   - Go to "Table Editor" in Supabase
   - You should see all the tables created
   - Check that sample data was inserted

### 2. Install Missing Dependencies

Your app needs a few additional packages. Run these commands:

```bash
npm install @next-auth/prisma-adapter
npm install bcryptjs
npm install @types/bcryptjs
```

### 3. Test the Application

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit the application**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should see the updated landing page
   - Navigate to `/dashboard` to see the full interface

3. **Test API endpoints**
   - Try `http://localhost:3000/api/players` to see the players API
   - Try `http://localhost:3000/api/projections` for projections

## What's Been Created

### ✅ API Endpoints
- **`/api/players`** - GET (list players), POST (create player)
- **`/api/players/[id]`** - GET (player details), PATCH (update), DELETE (remove)
- **`/api/projections`** - GET (list projections), POST (create projection)

### ✅ UI Components
- **`PlayerCard`** - Displays individual player information
- **`PlayersList`** - Searchable, filterable player grid with pagination
- **Dashboard Page** - Complete admin interface

### ✅ TypeScript Types
- **Database Types** (`src/types/database.ts`) - 20+ interfaces for database entities
- **API Types** (`src/types/api.ts`) - Request/response types for all endpoints
- **Projection Types** (`src/types/projections.ts`) - Advanced analytics and ML types
- **Utility Types** (`src/types/index.ts`) - Type guards, helpers, and constants

### ✅ Database Schema
- **Complete PostgreSQL schema** with all tables, relationships, and constraints
- **Performance optimized** with proper indexes
- **Security enabled** with Row Level Security
- **Sample data** for immediate testing

## Features Available

### Player Management
- Search players by name
- Filter by position, team, active status
- Sort by various criteria
- Paginated results
- Detailed player profiles

### Projection System
- Multi-model projection support
- Confidence scoring
- Floor/ceiling estimates
- Historical tracking
- Model performance metrics

### Risk Analysis
- Injury risk assessment
- Performance volatility
- Portfolio correlation
- Risk-adjusted scoring

### Analytics Ready
- Ensemble modeling framework
- Backtesting infrastructure
- Market data integration
- Optimization algorithms

## Next Development Steps

1. **Authentication Setup**
   - Create user registration/login flows
   - Set up proper user roles and permissions

2. **Data Population**
   - Import actual NFL player data
   - Set up automated data feeds
   - Create projection models

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Lineup optimization
   - Trade analysis
   - League management
   - Mobile responsiveness

## API Usage Examples

### Get All Players
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/players?position=QB&active=true&page=1');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.data); // Array of QB players
```

### Get Player Details with Projections
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/players/player-id?includeProjections=true');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.data.player); // Player info
console.log(data.data.projections); // Player projections
```

### Create New Projection
```javascript
const projection = {
  player_id: 'player-uuid',
  week: 1,
  season: 2025,
  points: 18.5,
  confidence: 0.85,
  model_type: 'ensemble'
};

const response = await fetch('/api/projections', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(projection)
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check that all import paths are correct

2. **Database connection errors**
   - Verify your `.env.local` file has correct Supabase credentials
   - Ensure the database schema has been executed

3. **API endpoints not working**
   - Check that the schema is properly installed
   - Verify table names match the schema

4. **TypeScript errors**
   - Many linting errors from generated files can be ignored
   - Focus on fixing errors in your custom code

### Getting Help

- Check the console for detailed error messages
- Review the API responses for debugging information
- Verify database tables exist in Supabase dashboard
